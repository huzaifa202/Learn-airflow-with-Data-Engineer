Airflow DAG for Welcome Message, Date, and Random Quote
This Airflow DAG is designed to perform the following tasks:

Print a Welcome Message: It starts by printing a simple "Welcome to Airflow!" message.
Print Today's Date: It retrieves the current date and prints it in a user-friendly format.
Fetch and Print a Random Quote: It uses the Quotable.io API to fetch a random quote and prints it to the console.
Benefits:

Demonstrates basic Airflow concepts like PythonOperators, tasks, and dependencies.
Provides a starting point for building more complex DAGs.
Running the DAG:

Save the code as a Python file (e.g., welcome_dag.py).
Set up your Airflow environment. Ensure you have Airflow installed and configured.
Schedule the DAG (optional): The DAG is configured to run daily at 11 PM UTC (0 23 * * *) using the schedule parameter. You can modify this schedule or trigger the DAG manually through the Airflow UI.
How it Works:

The DAG is defined using the DAG class from airflow.
PythonOperators are used to execute Python functions for each task.
The default_args dictionary sets the start date (one day before today) and disables catchup (prevents backfilling for missed runs).
The tasks are chained using the >> operator, ensuring they run in the specified order.
Customization:

You can modify the Python functions (print_welcome, print_date, print_random_quote) to incorporate different functionalities.
Customize the schedule (schedule) to fit your requirements.
Consider error handling and logging for robust DAG operation.
This is a basic but informative README file for your Airflow code. You can add more details as your DAG evolves.
